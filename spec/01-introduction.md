#Introduction
This specification is intended to provide a complete and concise
definition of the syntax and semantics of the PHP language, suitable for
use by the following:

-   Implementers of a PHP compiler.
-   Implementers of a test suite for the PHP language.
-   Programmers writing PHP code.

For now, the runtime library has been excluded, as that is documented at
[www.php.net](http://www.php.net). However, the document can contain references
to the library functions, usually in the form of links to http://www.php.net.
